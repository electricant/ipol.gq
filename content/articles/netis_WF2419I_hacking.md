# Netis WF2419I Router Hacking Diary

## Introduction

I had an old (2014-ish) and cheap (if I recall correctly it cost me around 15-20
â‚¬) Netis WF2419I [\[1\]][1] router collecting dust in a cabinet at home. Its
performance has always been lackluster with the WiFi connection dropping and
restarting every few minutes. I bought it to serve as a guest AP for my dorm
while I was studying in Padova. It worked dutifully for a few years there but, 
after I moved, I've never used it any more and switched to a whole different
setup (which I hope to describe in another post) with more powerful hardware.

This router was almost forgotten, until I read an excellent article by George
Hilliard [\[2\]][2] about hacking Reolink cameras. I had no plans to use this 
device in any case, given that it is rather old and crappy. So reading the
article was enough to spark my interest in trying to reverse engineer and add
as much new functionality as possible to this piece of hardware (or, perhaps,
should I say "junk"?). It surely won't be missed if something goes wrong in the
process.

First off let's set some goals to keep us on track:
 * Open the router and identify chipset, RAM, FLASH size and serial port
 * Dump the flash contents and inspect them
 * Rebuild a bootable image from the extracted contents and flash it
 * Setup a working buildroot image and compile a statically-linked busybox
 * Compile a (hopefully working) custom kernel for the device 

As you can see some of those goals are not easy. Moreover, Murphy's law gets you
every time and many roadblocks were encountered during this journey. I will not
spare any of the details, including the __MANY__ failed attempts. That's why 
I'm calling this page a diary.

At the time of writing I'm quite far from completion. Depending how long this
page grows I might decide to split this post into a series. Code and raw notes
are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/electricant/netis-wf2419-router-hacking).

## Opening up the Device & Talking to the Serial Port

This is the easy part. Actually, before rushing to the screwdriver to open the
chassis, we can search for the FCC ID of the device on the back of the unit.
Every RF device needs to be FCC certified to be sold and imported in the US
[\[3\]][3] and this router is no exception. On the lower-right corner of the
label we can read the FCC ID: <tt>T58WF2419R</tt>. By searching for this ID on
the [official FCC website](https://www.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid) or on
[fccid.io](https://fccid.io/T58WF2419R) we already have access to many low-level
details about the router, including internal photos.

Stop wandering around the FCC website reading test reports! Given my goals,
access to the flash chip is needed so I have to open the device anyway. This was
as easy as just removing the two screws on the bottom side (one is hidden by the
mandatory 'warranty void if seal is broken' sticker, about which I couldn't care
less) and popping open the case.

With the case open, the following components appear before us onto the sea of
green of the board and are highlighted in the picture below:
 * Realtek RTL8196C - the main router chipset
 * Realtek RTL8192CE - WiFi chipset
 * Winbond W25Q32FV - 32Mbit (4MB) SPI FLASH memory
 * ESMT M12L128168A - 2M x 16 Bit x 4 Banks (16MB) SDRAM
 * A few test points, probably for JTAG and UART access

</figure>

The usual first step is to see if a serial port is exposed somewhere on the
board in order to have access to a shell on the device. As shown in the picture
above, just by looking at the board, I already identified a few suitable
testpoints. Just to be sure and also for future use, let's look up on our
favourite search engine for the main router chipset datasheet. As expected,
somebody (thank you!) released a confidential copy for us to read [\[4\]][4].
Let's neglect all the other details for the moment and scroll right-ahead to the
pinout: we are looking for a serial port.

Look at the above picture. In the bottom-right part there are two pins (pin 36
and 37) labelled <tt>UART\_RX/GPIOA7</tt> and <tt>UART\_TX/GPIOB0</tt>
respectively. Those pins can be configured either as GPIOs (for controlling the
router LEDs etc.) or as a serial port. I traced those two pins with a multimeter
and they are routed to the unpopulated header labelled <tt>J1</tt>. Most likely,
they are the serial port I'm looking for. Time to solder a pin header and
connect a TTL to USB adapter and see who's there. But HEI! Wait! What's the baud
rate? A quick check with an oscilloscope revealed it's <tt>38400bps</tt>. I know
using an oscilloscope for this task it's a bit of an overkill, but I had one on
hand so why not using it? By the way, some trial and error works too.

Quite an ancient software stack. Isn't it?

Now that I have grabbed some basic information about the system it's time to
move on and see what's inside the flash chip.

## Dumping The Flash Contents

I had already identified the chip by visual inspection while opening the router:
it is a Winbond W25Q32FV chip. Time to download its datasheet [\[5\]][5] to get
the pinout and connect it to our beloved Bus Pirate [\[6\]][6]. The Bus Pirate
is a small and useful board to talk to and interact with digital stuff. Out of
the box it supports the following interfaces: 1-Wire, 2-Wire, 3-Wire, I2C, SPI,
JTAG, UART and LCD. Alternatively the GPIO pins can be directly controlled and
many more protocols can be added using aftermarket firmware images since it is
all open source.

<figure>
<a href="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif">
	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_pinout.gif"/>
</a>
<figcaption>Winbond W25Q32FV flash chip pinout.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now that I know the pinout of the chip, I have to figure out how to connect it
for <tt>flashrom</tt> [\[7\]][7] to read it. I'll try In-System Programming
(ISP) [\[8\]][8] first since it is much quicker and does not require reworking
the board every time I have to read or write the flash. If this won't work the
only solution is to desolder and resolder the flash chip from the board every
time. This is time consuming and I'd like to avoid it at all cost.

A quick reverse engineering of the traces around the chip revealed that pin 3 
and pin 7 (<tt>/WP</tt> and <tt>/HOLD</tt> respectively) which, according to
[\[7\]][7] should be connected to 3.3V on the bus pirate, are already tied to
the VCC pin (pin 8). Therefore, only 6 out of the 8 required wires have to be
connected.

Twenty minutes with my trusty soldering iron and a piece of an old ATA cable
(the 80-wire version which uses smaller conductors) and I have created a nice
little connector ready to be plugged into the Bus Pirate socket.

<figure>

	<img src="/res/img/wf2419_hacking/flash_buspirate.jpg"/>
</a>
<figcaption>Bus Pirate ISP connection to the flash chip.</figcaption>
</figure>

To check for a successful connection I issued the following command:

	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M
	[sudo] password for pol: 
	flashrom v1.2 on Linux 5.7.0-2-amd64 (x86_64)
	flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org

	Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
	Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q32.V" (4096 kB, SPI) on buspirate_spi.
	No operations were specified.

Hurray! The flash chip was recognized correctly. Time to dump its contents.
	
	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -r firmware_orig.bin

To see what's inside the image named <tt>firmware\_orig.bin</tt> I extracted it
recursively with the following command. At the end of the process binwalk
creates a folder named <tt>\_firmware\_orig.bin.extracted</tt> containing the
files extracted from the various file systems it found.

	$ binwalk -e firmware_orig.bin 

	DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

Or that was the expectation. What are those warnings and why is my folder
<tt>squashfs-root</tt> empty?  Apparently sasquatch is not installed in my
system and <tt>$ sudo apt search sasquatch</tt> does not return any result.
Alright it's not the first time I have to compile and install something from
source on my system. It's strange however that the Debian repos are missing this
useful piece of software. Sasquatch is downloaded from [\[9\]][9] and
<tt>build.sh</tt> does all the requisite stuff for building and installing.

As usual, the process is never as easy as running a single command. The
building fails with a ton of messages like the following:

	/usr/bin/ld: unsquashfs_xattr.o:/tmp/article/sasquatch/squashfs4.3/squashfs-tools/error.h:34: multiple definition of `verbose'; unsquashfs.o:/tmp/article/sasquatch/squashfs4.3/squashfs-tools/error.h:34: first defined here
	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
	make: *** [Makefile:298: sasquatch] Error 1

By looking at the issues and pull requests of sasquatch I found
[pull request #34](https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch/pull/34). After
applying it to my local copy of the code the compilation is successful. I'm now
ready to go ahead with the extraction.

Great. The image contains some LZMA compressed data, probably kernel and
bootloader, and a squashfs file system [\[10\]][10]. Conveniently binwalk will
recursively extract those files and what I got was a kernel (version 2.4.18 of 
course), some certificates and the contents of the root file system which I am
now able to inspect and modify as I please. The expert reader (or my future self
if he learned something from this endeavour) may already have noticed the first
mistake here. If nothing above looks wrong fasten your seat belt we're going
deep down a rabbit hole.

## Rebuilding the Flash Image and First Roadblocks

This is the root folder structure of the extracted image:

	$ ls -l _firmware_orig.bin.extracted/squashfs-root/
	total 0
	drwxr-xr-x 2 pol pol 3580 Jun 30  2015 bin
	drwxrwxrwx 2 pol pol   60 Jun 30  2015 dev
	drwxrwxrwx 3 pol pol  600 Jun 30  2015 etc
	drwxr-xr-x 2 pol pol  320 Jun 30  2015 lib
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 pol pol   10 Sep 11 12:39 media -> /var/media
	drwxrwxrwx 2 pol pol   40 Jun 30  2015 proc
	drwxr-xr-x 2 pol pol  180 Jun 30  2015 sbin
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 pol pol    8 Sep 11 12:39 sys -> /var/sys
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 pol pol    8 Sep 11 12:39 tmp -> /var/tmp
	drwxr-xr-x 4 pol pol   80 Jun 30  2015 usr
	drwxrwxrwx 2 pol pol   40 Jun 30  2015 var
	drwxr-xr-x 8 pol pol  300 Jun 30  2015 web
	
The easiest thing to do is modifying the index.htm of the router configuration
webpage adding some test code just to see if everything in the process of
extraction and rebuilding worked. I copied the directory
<tt>firmware_orig.bin.extracted</tt> and its contents to
<tt>firmware.extracted_new</tt> in order to preserve the original files. Then I
modified <tt>firmware.extracted_new/squashfs-root/web/index.htm</tt> by
appending the following lines just before the closing html tag.
	
	<script>
		alert("I have been pwned!");
	</script>

This should display an alert window as soon as the page is loaded.

Save and close. Now it's time to rebuild the image and see if it boots. But
before attempting to re-create it, I need more details about the file system.

The first root file system creation attempt was done using the version of 
squashfs-tools provided by the Debian packages (version 4.4 at the time of
writing).

	$ mksquashfs squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend

	$ unsquashfs -s D0000.new.squashfs

Apart from the different superblock version, we have that the file system size
is bigger, the endiannes is gone and the number of inodes is lower than the
original image. What is going on? I decided to tackle one issue at a time.

First of all is the squashfs file system backwards-compatible? Apparently
SquashFS v4.0 moved to a fixed little-endian format (even for big-endian
systems). The odds of the new image booting are already quite low. For the sake
of science I decided to find it out the hard way.

	$ cp ../firmware_orig.bin firmware_pwned.bin
	$ dd if=D0000.new.squashfs of=firmware_pwned.bin bs=1 seek=$((0xD0000)) conv=notrunc
	$ sudo flashrom -p buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0,spispeed=2M -w firmware.extracted_new/firmware_pwned.bin 

And sure enough when I turned on the router, carefully monitoring the serial 
output, the device is unable to mount the root file system and is stuck in a
bootloop.

### The Hard Way

Of course it could not be so easy. We need an older version of squashfs,
supporting setting a different endiannes. Is there a different/lower version of
squashfs-tools in the Debian repos? Of course not. I have to compile my own. Who
cares I'm already used to that. The first thing I did was to download the
[squashfs sources for version 2.2-r2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/files/squashfs/squashfs2.2-r2/).
And once again the stock sources cannot be compiled with gcc 10. I learned, 
after trial and error, that this is due to different gcc behaviour and
due to some symbols moved to different header files. To get this squashfs-tools
version compile on my system I had to apply the following changes:

	$ diff -u squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools squashfs-tools

Figuring out why the code was not building and what to do to make gcc accept it
took me quite a while. However, now that I have a working copy of mksquashfs 
version 2, I can try to rebuild the file system:

	$ squashfs/squashfs2.2-r2/squashfs-tools/mksquashfs squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend -2.0 -be

	$ unsquashfs -s D0000.new.squashfs

	Number of inodes 366
	Number of uids 1
	Number of gids 0

The issue about endiannes and superblock version are solved. There is still a
different number of inodes and a bigger file system size. But hey, who cares
right? I flashed it into the router right-away, repeating the steps in the
previous section, but the device is still stuck in a boot loop.

What are those missing inodes anyway? Maybe extracting the SquashFS file system
manually will yield more information.

	$ unsquashfs D0000.squashfs 
	Reading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on D0000.squashfs
	read_ids: Bad inode count in super block
	File system corruption detected
	FATAL ERROR:failed to read file system tables

Now I'm getting why binwalk was using sasquatch to extract the root file system
image. Let's do the same

	$ sasquatch D0000.squashfs 
	SquashFS version [512.0] / inode count [-2063532032] suggests a SquashFS image of a different endianess

	[... lots of lines as the one above ...]
	
	created 237 files
	created 20 directories
	created 109 symlinks
	created 0 devices
	created 0 fifos

This was one of those moments when you realize you were barking up the wrong
tree all the time. Facepalm. The missing inodes are the character devices
[\[11\]][11]. Of course nothing will boot! Upon extraction, binwalk did not
have the required permissions to create such files. I have to extract the file
system as root to get the whole contents of the image:

	$ sudo sasquatch D0000.squashfs 
	[sudo] password for pol: 
	SquashFS version [512.0] / inode count [-2063532032] suggests a SquashFS image of a different endianess

	created 237 files
	created 20 directories
	created 109 symlinks
	created 23 devices
	created 0 fifos

Now we are talking! Well... not really. If I rebuild the file system once again
as I did before, the only difference now is file system size. However, the
router is still stuck in a bootloop. A quick check to the size of the final
flash image size confirms that the new image is not too big to fit in the flash
chip. What is still missing is the correct compression algorithm. By looking at
the output above we see that lzma-adaptive compression was detected. Version 2.2
of mksquashfs does not support lzma compression by default. A working copy of
squashfs-lzma [\[12\]][12] is needed. But I was fed up of blindly trying stuff
until something works, so I downloaded the GPL code [\[13\]][13] (thanks Richard
Stallman) for my router model and started inspecting the package contents to
find some clues about how the flash image is built. 

### GPL Code is Fun

Inside the package I found the directory
<tt>GPL\_Code\_RTL/rtl819x-sdk-v1.2/AP/squashfs-tools</tt> . After copying it
somewhere else to preserve the original files, I had to patch the code inside
the new directory in a similar fashion as SquashFS 2.2-r2.

	$ diff -ru squashfs-tools-orig squashfs-tools/

	 #include <errno.h>

After that, I compiled the sources with <tt>make</tt> and I got a fancy new
executable to play with: <tt>mksquashfs-lzma</tt>. It can be used to build the
new file system as usual.

	$ squashfs/squashfs-tools/mksquashfs-lzma squashfs-root D0000.new.squashfs -b 65536 -all-root -noappend -be

After flashing the new image the router boots successfully. If I point my
browser to its configuration page (available at <tt>http://192.168.1.1</tt> by
default) and log in with the default credentials the following webpage appears.

	</a>
	<figcaption>Success! A pwned index.htm appears.</figcaption>
</figure>

Hurray! This means that I can now do whatever I want with the root file system!
To avoid manually entering a series of commands every time I want to build a
new image, I created a small script available on GitHub [\[14\]][14].

## Compiling Software and More Roadblocks

custom kernel? I need a working compiler for the architecture
(this looks impossible)

buildroot

patches

compiling stuff and endiannes

stuck! illegal instruction

	# busybox\_p
	Illegal instruction
	# telnetd
	Illegal instruction

flip table and go working to something else

## Conclusion

Apply patchset manually ?

Use a different buildroot version ?

Is it worth it ? No

Still good training time to tackle something else (more to follow)
