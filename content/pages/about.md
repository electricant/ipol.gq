# About me

I'm currently living in Padua where I'm studying Electronic Engineering.

I love creating stuff. I like to think as myself as a craftsman. My motto is:
"If you want a job well done you have to do it yourself".

I've been interested in electronics since my childhood. During the years I've
also been attracted by computer science, programming and technology in general.

You can contact me at [pol@ipol.gq](mailto:pol@ipol.gq).

Se my projects on [github](https://github.com/electricant) or
[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/paolo_scr).

# About this Website

This website is made up by a static page served by
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/). All the content is provided by a backend
written in [lisp](http://lispers.org/) using the
[hunchentoot](http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/) web server. The pages are written in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and are translated
into HTML on the fly by the backend. Javascript is the duct tape that keeps
static and dynamic content together.

You may ask: "Why roll your own solution when there's plenty of blogging
solutions?". The answer is because I can.
