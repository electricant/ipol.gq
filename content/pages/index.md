Hi! I'm Paolo and this is my blog.

Here I write about electronics, radio-frequency, hardware hacking and more!

I've been interested in electronics since my childhood. During the years I've
also been attracted by computer science, programming and technology in general.

I love creating stuff and I like to describe myself as a craftsman.

My motto is: *"If you want a job well done you have to do it yourself"*.
