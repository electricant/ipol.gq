Hi! I'm Paolo and this is my home page.

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering, University of
Padova, where I study radio-frequency analog integrated circuits.

I've been interested in electronics since my childhood. During the years I've
also been attracted by computer science, programming and technology in general.

I love creating stuff and I like to think as myself as a craftsman.

My motto is: *"If you want a job well done you have to do it yourself"*.
