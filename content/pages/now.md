# Now

This is a list of things I'm up to now:

* Learning functional programming and AI (this may take a long time)
* Create things both hardware and software
* Blog about things I create and about interesting stuff
* The Ph.D. which is taking up most of my time
* I'm really into swimming and scuba diving.
* I love tasting craft beers (expecially english ales).
