net. I try to add a small comment after each link in order to provide some
context about it.

	<br>A great essay highlighting difficulties most intentional communities
	fail. All in all *"communities are just fractals of society"*.

* [Better Than Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/better-than-fre) <br>
	Article by Kevin Kelly. It points out how the internet is a copy machine
	that has made many things worthless and for what the people is still willing
	to pay.

* [How totalism works](https://aeon.co/essays/how-cult-leaders-brainwash-followers-for-total-control) <br>

	*"This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address climate
	 change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and politics."*
	<br>
	Also on the same line:
	[Conscious consumerism is a lie. Here’s a better way to help save the world](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/)

* [Teaching ‘grit’ is bad for children, and bad for democracy](https://aeon.co/ideas/teaching-grit-is-bad-for-children-and-bad-for-democracy) <br>

* [Return of the city-state](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us) <br>
	*"This is the crux of the problem: nation-states rely on control. If they
	can’t control information, crime, businesses, borders or the money supply,
	then they will cease to deliver what citizens demand of them. In the end,
	nation-states are nothing but agreed-upon myths: we give up certain freedoms
	in order to secure others. But if that transaction no longer works, and we
	stop agreeing on the myth, it ceases to have power over us."*

* [The good guy/bad guy myth](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-pop-culture-obsessed-with-battles-between-good-and-evil) <br>
	*"Good guy/bad guy narratives might not possess any moral sophistication, but they do promote social stability, and they’re useful for getting people to sign up for armies and fight in wars with other nations. Their values feel like morality, and the association with folklore and mythology lends them a patina of legitimacy, but still, they don’t arise from a moral vision. They are rooted instead in a political vision, which is why they don’t help us deliberate, or think more deeply about the meanings of our actions."*

* [How to Get Rich](https://www.edge.org/conversation/how-to-get-rich)
	<br/>The title is kind of a clickbait. This is a talk by Jared Diamond,
	author of *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. It is a summary of his book.

* [Fitter, Happier, More Productive… and other fantasies of millennial life](https://slightlymarxistfounder.com/2018/03/10/fitter-happier-more-productive/)

	article above)

* [Orwell knew: we willingly buy the screens that are used against us](https://aeon.co/ideas/orwell-knew-we-willingly-buy-the-screens-that-are-used-against-us)

* [Caves all the way down](https://aeon.co/essays/is-psychedelics-research-closer-to-theology-than-to-science)
	<br/>Different cultures approach and experience psychedelics in different
	ways.

* [Is Everything a MLM (Multi Level Marketing scheme)](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/is-everything-an-mlm)
	<br/>Critical article about PhD and academic jobs in general.
	<br/> *"too many people coming through grad school, and too few sustainable
	academic jobs. And as anyone in any field understands, when there’s way more 
	qualified applicants than jobs, the existing jobs can demand more of
	applicants (more qualifications, less money) while applicants lower their
	own expectations (for compensation, for benefits, for job security, for
	course load and service, for location)."*

* [Ursula K. Le Guin - A Left-Handed Commencement Address (Mills College, 1983)](http://ursulakleguin.com/LeftHandMillsCollege.html)
	<br/>Talk given by Ursula K. Le Guin at the Mills College. It is about

	thought.

* [A Hidden Order of Reality](http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion-literature-culture/gili-kliger-hidden-order-reality)
	<br/>Article about the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss.
	<br/>*"No amount of conviction in my freedom can unburden me of the
	structures that impose their contours on daily existence. And that studying
	the way those structures operate —in our schools, through our prison system,
	in what we see when we turn on the television— constituted the first step in
	combatting the awesome reaches of their power."*

* [How to Ruin a Country in Three Decades](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-to-ruin-a-country-in-three-decades)
	<br/>Article about the roots of Italy's economic crisis

* [How Information Got Re-Invented](http://nautil.us/issue/51/limits/how-information-got-re_invented)
	<br/>The story behind Shannon's theory of information

* [Paradise Lost?—The iron cage of consumerism](https://timjackson.org.uk/consumerism-theodicy/)
	<br/>*"Far from creating a credible eschatology, consumerism appears to be a continuous exercise in denial of our own mortality and of the widespread suffering in the world."*
	<br/>*"we might usefully conclude, countering consumerism must start from more robust secular (or religious) theodicy: the building of meaning structures, communities of meaning, that lie outside the realm of the market; and that offer credible answers to the deep foundational questions that continue to haunt us."*

### Car and traffic related

It seems as if I quite dislike the idea of being forced to own a car.
This is a list of articles on such topic.

	*"If the price of gasoline and the vehicles that burn it actually reflected
	the true costs and damage they inflict, the common car would go extinct.
	Gasoline would cost way more than $10 a gallon."*

* [The Social Ideology of the Motorcar](http://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/)
	<br/>*"This 1973 essay on how cars have taken over our cities remains as
	relevant as ever"*

### Relationships

	citizens – in mutually beneficial activities."*
