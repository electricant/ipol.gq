# Random Stuff

This page contains some links to interesting things I found while surfing the
net. The order is random, the goal is to put the most recent things first and
group stuff by topic but don't take it for granted. I try to add a small comment
after each link in order to provide some context about it.

* [Angels in the Market](https://aeon.co/essays/from-home-to-market-a-history-of-white-womens-power-in-the-us)
	<br/>The heart-tug tactics of 1950s ads steered white American women away
	from activism into domesticity. They’re still there.

* [In a pandemic we learn again what Sartre meant by being free](https://psyche.co/ideas/in-a-pandemic-we-learn-again-what-sartre-meant-by-being-free)

* [How do people learn to cook a poisonous plant safely?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48859333)<br/>
	Intresting comparison between the development of culture and the
	scientific method. However I do not fully agree with the article since
	science, the same way as our culture, develops by emulation and
	improvement on previous results by other people.

* [The Transistor, Part 1: Groping in the Dark](https://technicshistory.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/the-transistor-part-1-groping-in-the-dark/)

	Essay about how our consumerism culture relates to depression and
	demoralization.

* [Like start-ups, most intentional communities fail – why? | Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/like-start-ups-most-intentional-communities-fail-why)
	<br>A great essay highlighting difficulties most intentional communities
	fail. All in all *"communities are just fractals of society"*.

* [Better Than Free](http://kk.org/thetechnium/better-than-fre) <br>
	Article by Kevin Kelly. It points out how the internet is a copy machine

	willing to pay.

* [How totalism works](https://aeon.co/essays/how-cult-leaders-brainwash-followers-for-total-control) <br>

	<br> *"This is the con-job of neoliberalism: to persuade us to address
	climate change through our pocket-books, rather than through power and
	politics."*
	<br> Also on the same line: [Conscious consumerism is a lie.  Here’s a better way to help save the world](https://qz.com/920561/conscious-consumerism-is-a-lie-heres-a-better-way-to-help-save-the-world/)

* [Law in the Jungle](https://aeon.co/essays/the-subalterns-are-speaking-whos-listening) <br>
	 Essay on the Jungle refugee camp in Calais. The article deals with how it
	 became its own society and what this meant.

* [Teaching ‘grit’ is bad for children, and bad for democracy](https://aeon.co/ideas/teaching-grit-is-bad-for-children-and-bad-for-democracy) <br>
	Apparently grit does more harm than good. The author explains *"how a grit
	culture contributes to an authoritarian politics, one where leaders expect
	the masses to stay on task."*

* [Return of the city-state](https://aeon.co/essays/the-end-of-a-world-of-nation-states-may-be-upon-us) <br>
	*"This is the crux of the problem: nation-states rely on control. If they
	can’t control informatiLaughter is vital on, crime, businesses, borders or the money supply,
	then they will cease to deliver what citizens demand of them. In the end,
	nation-states are nothing but agreed-upon myths: we give up certain
	freedoms in order to secure others. But if that transaction no longer
	works, and we stop agreeing on the myth, it ceases to have power over
	us."*

	privatization of social services"*

* [The good guy/bad guy myth](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-pop-culture-obsessed-with-battles-between-good-and-evil) <br>
	*"Good guy/bad guy narratives might not possess any moral sophistication,
	but they do promote social stability, and they’re useful for getting
	people to sign up for armies and fight in wars with other nations. Their
	values feel like morality, and the association with folklore and mythology
	lends them a patina of legitimacy, but still, they don’t arise from a
	moral vision. They are rooted instead in a political vision, which is why
	they don’t help us deliberate, or think more deeply about the meanings of
	our actions."*

* [How to Get Rich](https://www.edge.org/conversation/how-to-get-rich)
	<br/>The title is kind of a clickbait. This is a talk by Jared Diamond,
	author of *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. It is a summary of his book.

* [Fitter, Happier, More Productive… and other fantasies of millennial life](https://slightlymarxistfounder.com/2018/03/10/fitter-happier-more-productive/)

	<br/>Pet dogs often have a peaceful death that forestalls protracted
	suffering and pain. Why can’t we do the same for humans? (see also the
	article above)

* [Orwell knew: we willingly buy the screens that are used against us](https://aeon.co/ideas/orwell-knew-we-willingly-buy-the-screens-that-are-used-against-us)

* [Caves all the way down](https://aeon.co/essays/is-psychedelics-research-closer-to-theology-than-to-science)
	<br/>Different cultures approach and experience psychedelics in different
	ways.

* [Is Everything a MLM (Multi Level Marketing scheme)](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/is-everything-an-mlm)
	<br/>Critical article about PhD and academic jobs in general.
	<br/> *"too many people coming through grad school, and too few
	sustainable academic jobs. And as anyone in any field understands, when
	there’s way more qualified applicants than jobs, the existing jobs can
	demand more of applicants (more qualifications, less money) while
	applicants lower their own expectations (for compensation, for benefits,
	for job security, for course load and service, for location)."*

* [Ursula K. Le Guin - A Left-Handed Commencement Address (Mills College, 1983)](http://ursulakleguin.com/LeftHandMillsCollege.html)
	<br/>Talk given by Ursula K. Le Guin at the Mills College. It is about

	thought.

* [A Hidden Order of Reality](http://bostonreview.net/philosophy-religion-literature-culture/gili-kliger-hidden-order-reality)
	<br/>Article about the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss.
	<br/>*"No amount of conviction in my freedom can unburden me of the
	structures that impose their contours on daily existence. And that
	studying the way those structures operate —in our schools, through our
	prison system, in what we see when we turn on the television— constituted
	the first step in combatting the awesome reaches of their power."*

* [How to Ruin a Country in Three Decades](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/how-to-ruin-a-country-in-three-decades)
	<br/>Article about the roots of Italy's economic crisis

* [How Information Got Re-Invented](http://nautil.us/issue/51/limits/how-information-got-re_invented)
	<br/>The story behind Shannon's theory of information

* [Paradise Lost?—The iron cage of consumerism](https://timjackson.org.uk/consumerism-theodicy/)
	<br/>*"Far from creating a credible eschatology, consumerism appears to be
	a continuous exercise in denial of our own mortality and of the widespread
	suffering in the world."* <br/>*"we might usefully conclude, countering
	consumerism must start from more robust secular (or religious) theodicy:
	the building of meaning structures, communities of meaning, that lie
	outside the realm of the market; and that offer credible answers to the
	deep foundational questions that continue to haunt us."*

* [Economists Are Obsessed with “Job Creation.” How About Less Work?](http://evonomics.com/less-work-job-creation-peter-gray/)

	*"If the price of gasoline and the vehicles that burn it actually
	reflected the true costs and damage they inflict, the common car would go
	extinct.  Gasoline would cost way more than $10 a gallon."*

* [The Social Ideology of the Motorcar](http://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/)
	<br/>*"This 1973 essay on how cars have taken over our cities remains as

	fellow citizens – in mutually beneficial activities."*

## Various Guides, Lectures and Books

* [How to be Indistractable](https://psyche.co/guides/to-become-indistractable-recognise-that-it-starts-within-you)

	body?"*
